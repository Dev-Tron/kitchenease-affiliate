Air fryers have quickly become a staple in modern kitchens. For busy families, they offer a healthier and faster alternative to traditional frying while keeping cleanup simple. But with so many models on the market, how do you choose the right one without overspending?

<div class="gap-section"></div>

<h1 classname="segment">Why Choose an Air Fryer?</h1>
- **Healthier meals** â€“ uses little to no oil  
- **Faster cooking** â€“ great for school nights when time is tight  
- **Easy cleanup** â€“ dishwasher-safe baskets save you time  
- **Kid-friendly** â€“ reheats leftovers and frozen snacks perfectly  

<div class="gap-section"></div>

<h1 classname="segment"> What to Look For in a Family Air Fryer</h1>
When shopping for a family-sized air fryer, consider:

1. **Capacity** â€“ look for 5â€“7 quarts if cooking for 3â€“5 people  
2. **Programs** â€“ presets for fries, chicken, or reheating can make life easier  
3. **Basket vs. oven** â€“ baskets are easier to clean, oven-style can fit more  
4. **Price** â€“ budget models under $100 can perform surprisingly well  
5. **Warranty** â€“ a 1â€“2 year warranty is a sign of reliability
