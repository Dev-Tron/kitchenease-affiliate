## 🧠 5 Smart Tips for a More Organized Kitchen

### 1. Declutter Your Counters  
Only leave out the things you use every single day. Everything else? Tuck it into drawers, bins, or cabinets.

---

### 2. Go Vertical  
Hooks, racks, and pegboards let you use your walls — not your countertop — to store tools and utensils.

---

### 3. Organize Your Drawers  
Drawer dividers are magic. They keep cutlery, tools, and kitchen gadgets neat and easy to grab.

---

### 4. Use Hidden Spaces  
Install bins under the sink and racks behind cabinet doors. These “invisible” areas can store a surprising amount.

---

### 5. Clear Pantry Containers  
Clear jars or bins make it easy to see what you’ve got — and look so much better than cluttered boxes and bags.
